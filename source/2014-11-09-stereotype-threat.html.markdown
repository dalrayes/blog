_Stereotype_: commonly held belief about a social group that is an over generalization.

_Sterotype threat_: the fear that your behaviors will confirm a stereotype about a group you belong to or identify with.

Everyone is affected by stereotypes: we all have biases and assumptions about different groups of people. We have to acknowledge that these stereotypes exist, learn about them and understand the unfair elements of them.

As a female, working in a male-dominated business world, I have had to deal with overcoming many stereotypes of women. Women who chose lighter workloads, shorter hours, distracted by families, and are less committed to work (than men, of course). Although I managed to overcome these with coworkers and people who know me, the stereotypes would resurface when meeting/working with someone new, resulting in some anxiety and pressure to perform. I often found myself distancing from the stereotyped female group (i.e. I'm not interested in celebrity gossip)

Going into a new field, one where women make up only a quarter* of the workforce, I know that there will be stereotypes to deal with. I am already demonstrating stereotype threat! Nevertheless, I plan on taking the following steps to make this process smoother:

<li>Prepare cues to remind myself and other of my status and achievement</li>

<li>Remind myself about characteristics, skills, values that I view are important</li>

<li>Learn and continue to be inspired by female role models that excel in the field and challenge these stereotypes</li>

Although having homogeneous groups makes working in teams easy and efficient, they lack unique insights that diverse teams bring. Diversity can be difficult but we have to embrace it to increase performance.
