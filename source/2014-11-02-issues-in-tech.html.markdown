How Secure is your personal data?

_Data breaches jump in California and are expected to keep climbing_

Many of the headlines above are a result of poor online security provided by retailers. In the state of California, a reported 18.5m people had personal data stolen in 2013, a figure that includes the large attacks on Target and Living Social. With more and more personal data being stored and collected across the web, data breaches are expected to continue and increase in scale. There has been a big rise in passwords being stolen, with this year coming close to surpassing 2013 as the year with highest stolen personal data.

This has created a large market for security and privacy products. It has also resulted in the rise of new social media sites and platforms that pledge not to collect personal data or monetize it, such as Omlet, Ello, and search engine DuckDuckGo. However, increasing security comes at an added cost and therefore some companies are hesitant to implement. Also, many companies rely on commercial use of data collected for market research and advertising expenses for products and services.

With the size of the problem increasing, there has been more government intervention. For example, In the UK, new privacy standards are being developed by the Information Commissioner’s Office to publicly certify a company’s compliance with data protection laws. Industry consortiums have also been developed to jointly provide solutions. Founded in 2013, FIDO, the Fast Identity Online Alliance, is an industry consortium with the goal to develop a standard system for online authentication that reduces reliance on passwords (and eventually eliminate them). Members include Google, Microsoft, Nok Nok Labs and Samsung. FIDO has developed authentication standards that will be the ultimate game changer – allowing users to have more control of their credentials. The credentials will be stored on devices, and will only be used to unlock secure communication channels rather than be transmitted.

###Available Solutions
There are various solutions and technologies currently in the market _including_:

<li>For credit cards, the newer cards with chip or PIN codes, currently being rolled out all over the US, make it harder to hack databases of consumer data from retailers’ point of sale systems. These have been widely available to customers outside of the US, thus the lower rate of such incidents with international retailers.</li>

<li>Digital wallets (Apple Pay) etc. make payments more secure with biometric data (voice, facial, finger recognition). Biometric identification is quick, convenient and difficult to imitate. However, it requires compatible devices, apps or websites, and the data could be difficult to replace if lost or stolen.</li>

<li> Multi-factor authentication systems.</li>

<li>Smart keys, look like USB drives</li>

<br>
###Tips for you

<li>Try to pay in cash in smaller establishments, its probably [more secure](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-09/don-t-buy-pizza-with-a-credit-card) than using your credit card.</li>

<li>Try newer ways to pay, such as Apple Pay or PayPal in stores</li>

<li>Avoid reusing passwords and strengthen existing ones</li>

<li>Review your bank statements every month to check for unauthorized charges. If you notice one, ask to have a new card issued.</li>

<br>
###For an organization

<li>Organizations need to thoroughly review and understand all the code they are using – this is a key point since many companies take code from open source components that may be vulnerable to attacks.</li>

<li>Minimize amount of unnecessary customer data collected</li>

<li>Conduct regular audits of security measures</li>

<li>Educate employees about data security and their role in it</li>

<li>Develop a plan in case there is a failure.</li>
