title: PostgreSQL 9.5 & Homebrew: Not running after restart

I think my battery died last night on my Macbook and when I started the rails app I was working on this morning I saw this error:

PG::ConnectionBad (could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

None of my rake commands were working and I couldn't load my site on localhost.

I looked up the error and found these links the most useful:

1. https://kkob.us/2016/01/09/homebrew-and-postgresql-9-5/
2. https://coderwall.com/p/zf-fww/postgres-on-osx-with-homebrew-not-running-after-osx-crash
3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19828385/pgconnectionbad-could-not-connect-to-server-connection-refused

I ended up finding that somehow, I had two versions of postgres under usr/local/var (postgres) and (postgres9.5)

After much frustration, I did the following:

1. brew uninstall postgresql
2. gem uninstall pg
3. deleted all postgres files in usr/local/var
4. double checked there was no postgresql by running `brew list`
5. brew install postgresql
6. ran pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
7. checked that this works: ps x | grep postgres
 5141   ??  Ss     0:00.00 postgres: checkpointer process
 5142   ??  Ss     0:00.01 postgres: writer process
 5143   ??  Ss     0:00.00 postgres: wal writer process
 5144   ??  Ss     0:00.00 postgres: autovacuum launcher process
 5145   ??  Ss     0:00.00 postgres: stats collector process
 5133 s000  S      0:00.03 /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.5.0/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
 5161 s000  U+     0:00.00 grep postgres
8. Bundle install & Reboot rails!!


Side note: 
A fellow DBC alum recommended this command as well - you might find it useful:
`pg_ctl restart -D /usr/local/var/postgres -m fast `

This command kills postgres entirely, then restarts itâ€¦
