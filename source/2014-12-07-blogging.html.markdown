Now that I have my own website, I realize how much work and dedication it takes to keep it up to date and relevant. Blogging itself takes work/effort, and once you have readers (far from this point yet), its a commitment. I read a variety of blogs on a weekly basis, previously about general women's topics, business, design and style. I now have a roll of technology websites, blogs/ newsletters and twitter feeds to add to this list. Although going through them takes time, it is more of an effort to update as well, and it could really lead into a rabbit hole if you want to add so many different things at once!

I hope to utilize tools to keep the updating process more efficient and take advantage of technologies that will make my website more powerful...sit tight!
