I attended <a href="https://www.windycityrails.org" target="_blank">Windy City Rails</a> in Chicago last week, and it was my first ruby/rails related conference since graduating from Dev Bootcamp. I learned about a couple of interesting topics of which I will be posting after this.

One of the more interesting things I learned -a bit of an 'aha' moment- was from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jeffcohen" target='_blank'>Jeff Cohen</a>.  We spend a lot of time writing code and trying to learn new code by 'coding,' but what we tend to forget is that we can learn a ton from <em>reading</em> code.  It might not seem straightforward but Jeff talked about thinking of your favorite author, and thinking about how many books the author probably read vs. the books he/she wrote.

A good place to start is looking at your Gemfile, picking one of the gems you like, and checking out their source code on Github. You don't necessarily need to understand everything in the code, but you will surely see something interesting that you could look up and learn from!
