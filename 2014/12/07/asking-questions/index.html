       <h2>Asking Questions & Searching for Answers</h2>
      <p>Today is the last day of Phase 0 for my cohort at DBC, where we have spent the last 9 weeks learning from home. Working remotely has been interesting and very new to me. While we were in touch with each other for pairing sessions and general discussions on a Google group we are part of, a lot of the work was done on our own. This meant that most of the time, when I needed something clarified or got stuck writing code.... oh hello, Google search.</p>

<p>A lot of my queries led me to questions that had similar keywords posted on Stack Overflow, the Q&amp;A site for widely used by programmers. But the problem was exactly that - similar keywords. The questions that were posted often had nothing to do with what I was looking for and were unhelpful or had very different responses that just got me more confused.</p>

<p>To tackle this, I worked on improving my search queries:</p>

<p><li>Search the web for something very specific - one logical operation</li>
<li>Know what you expect your code to do</li>
<li>Highlight any constraints (i.e &quot;without jQuery&quot;)</li>
<li>End statement with &quot;in [language]&quot;</li></p>

<p>There is plenty of information on the web, but figuring out what to look for really comes down to how well you have broken down the problem at hand (smaller steps to solve it).</p>

<p>But, even with that, I really struggled with one of our challenges in Phase 0, and was very disappointed when searching online for hours and with multiple different queries was not getting me anywhere. At this point, I realized I had to get some help from someone else, a hint, and that helped me move forward.</p>
