       <h2>A week in the kitchen</h2>
      <p>My first week of Dev Bootcamp Phase 0 is coming to a close and its been busy but totally awesome.</p>

<p>its an eye opener to how little I know about this world and how much I will be learning over the next couple of months. With the week wrapping up, it was a good time to hear the DBC story from the founder himself, Shereef, in a (virtual) fireside chat. I can see that the culture at DBC and the values the program and the teachers stand for, trickle down from the top. The organization is passionate about unleashing each student&#39;s potential and promoting curiosity and learning in a safe environment.</p>

<p>Shereef presented an analogy that really resonated with me. He compared the mindset and attitude of students going into the program as going into a kitchen, rather than a restaurant. We are all familiar with what going to a restaurant is like - enter restaurant, build expectations, order, receive order/experience/service, pay, and leave. We go into a restaurant as consumers, and expect to get something (good, great, exceptional) because we feel owed. On the other hand, when we cook something in our own kitchen, we are more creative and carry fewer expectations. It is what you make of it; I can make an easy sandwich or cook an elaborate dish. I, along with any other chefs in the kitchen (read: my husband), are in it together and can experiment and create something amazing. We are in creator- and not consumer- mode. And that&#39;s what DBC is all about.</p>

<p>Having just completed an MBA from a highly competitive program, the DBC mantra feels very different to me, but is actually more comforting. I am entering a completely new field and I want to feel comfortable with my beginner level and &quot;not knowing&quot; everything. Its an environment that makes me a bit nervous, but very excited.</p>

<p>On this occasion (its my birthday!), a new year begins for me today, and I&#39;m ready to take on this fantastic journey.</p>
