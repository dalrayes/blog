<p>I&#39;ve been hearing the words git and GitHub over the last couple of weeks but like many of us at DBC, had no idea what they meant. After reading through the introduction material today, I think I now have a very rough idea of what they have been designed for, but have yet to fully learn each one&#39;s capabilities.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Git is a software that developers use on their computers (locally) to keep track of the code they write. The way git works is that it keeps copies (called commits) of the changes being made to the code, but instead of tracking every single keystroke, it tracks changes in bundles. Doing so allows the developer to go back and forth between the saved versions of the code. This is what is referred to as version control. Git is also cool because it allows developers to have a perfect (master) version of their code, and then create different branches or copies of that perfect code that they can play around with and use to test different things (without impacting the original perfect version). Its like cooking a stew, and then being able to test the addition of different spices: cinnamon, tumeric or dried coriander. Once you decide that tumeric is the best, you can add that in and forget the rest. In git terminology, that branch can then be merged into the master.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>GitHub is not to be confused with git itself. Github is a web based service that can be used to store git files, referred to as repositories. Github takes the advantage of collaboration using git to another level. Instead of just having a local based repository, git files are pushed to Github and can therefore be accessed via the web. This makes a lot of sense because it reminds me of writing group papers for classes before, and the pain of going through different versions on Word, until we discovered we could collaborate simultaneously using Google Docs (miracle!). Its not exactly the same, but Github allows simultaneous collaboration with a wider reach through the web, hence its popularity with developers.</p>

<p>I am starting to realize that unlike people in finance (sorry old friends), developers like sharing and helping each other out. This is definitely something well represented in the Git world. It may seem very confusing, but the analogy in this <a href="http://stephaniehoh.github.io/blog/2013/10/07/git-vs-github-for-dummies">link</a> really helped me visualize what its all about!</p>
